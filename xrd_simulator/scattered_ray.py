"""A scatterd ray object defines the convex scattering region of an element together with
its scattering vector and intensity scaling. It is meant to be eaten by a detector and rendered
into a pattern. The scatterd ray object is not a simmlified object but any approximations are
meant to be made during detector rendering. """
