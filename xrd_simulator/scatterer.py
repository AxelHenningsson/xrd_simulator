"""A scatterer object defines the convex scattering region of an element together with
its scattering vector kprime, intensity scaling and scan sequence position. It is meant to be 
eaten by a detector and rendered into a pattern. The scatterd ray object is not a simplified 
object but any approximations are meant to be made during detector rendering."""
